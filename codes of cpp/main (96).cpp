An STL is a library of generic functions and classes which saves you time and energy which you would have spent constructing for your use.
This helps you reuse these well tested classes and functions umpteenth number of times according to your own convenience. 
Suppose we have a container of integers, and we want to sort them in ascending order. 
We will have pointers which will help moving elements to places by pointing to it, following a well-constructed algorithm.
So, here a container gets sorted by following an algorithm by the use of pointers. This is how they work in accordance with each other.
